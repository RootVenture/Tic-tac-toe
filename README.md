# Tic Tac Toe

Project was built using VanillaJS and jQuery. Created a TicTacToe Constructor to fulfill the following user stories:

* User Story: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

* User Story: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

* User Story: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

* Created AI that utilizes a minimax algorithm to recursively calculate the best possible move based on the current board. See explanation of the algorithm here: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37
